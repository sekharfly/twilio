# Auto-generated code samples for the Twilio REST API

The code samples in this GitHub repository were automatically generated using a tool built at Twilio called Yoyodyne.

The samples are updated when there is a change to the Twilio API or to the code generation tool.

## Community contributions

Contributions are still welcome! If you see something that doesn't look right, or a sample that seems to be missing, please do
submit a PR. While we can't merge it directly in, it will help us improve the code samples for everyone.
